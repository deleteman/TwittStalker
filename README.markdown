# TwittStalker

How much does twitter know about you?

That's what this concept app will be able to answer, based on your public twitts, we'll show you (or anyone of your stalkers) all the information you're publishing to the web.

## Our main focus 

As a first step for answering this question, the app will focus on plotting the geographic information you share to the public on your tweets. This way you (an everyone else) can see what are the places you visit the most.

## More to come

But there is a lot of information that can be gathered from what you share, and hopefully, we'll eventually get to that:

*For instance:*

* Things you *do* and *don't* like. We can get this using NLP (Natural Lenguage Processing) on your tweets, categorizing and doing some sentiment analysis on them.
* What you tweet about on your different locations.
* What tweeting softare you use the most 
* And a lot of other interesting things about you! :)
